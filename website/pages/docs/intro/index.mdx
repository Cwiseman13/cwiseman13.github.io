# Intro to Sonrai DIG

Sonrai Dig is built on a sophisticated graph that continuously identifies and monitors every possible relationship
between identities and data that exists inside your public cloud.
Dig’s Governance Automation Engine automates workflow, remediation,
and prevention capabilities across cloud and security teams to ensure end-to-end security. Please see the
[documentation](/docs) provides a more detailed reference of available features.

## Eliminate All Identity Risks. Get to Least Privilege and Stay There

Uncover all identity and data relationships between people and non-people identities
(admins, roles, compute instances, serverless functions, and containers) across multi-cloud accounts
and 3rd-party data stores. Sonrai Dig, our identity and data governance platform,
graphs all access paths to enforce Least Privilege, and workflow enables certification of identities.
