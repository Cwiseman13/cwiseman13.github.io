# What is Sonrai Public Cloud Security Platform?

Sonrai Public Cloud Security Platform (Sonrai Platform) service provides a comprehensive view of data,identity,
protection, and infrastructure across all your Cloud Accounts. The service collects intelligence frommultiple cloud
platforms, providing a standard view across these environments of the data & identityrelationships.

Our goal is to reduce risk in multi-cloud environments, provide efficient cloud identity & datamonitoring,
identify potential data exposure points and provide compliance perspective across cloudinfrastructure,
independent of cloud platforms.Sonrai is a cloud-based SaaS service that deploys a workload into your cloud account,
continually collectsintelligence and reports this intelligence data back to Sonrai for analysis.

Monitoring of ongoing cloud and resource level audit allows Sonrai to monitor cloud activity for changes and build
a comprehensive view ofinformation in your cloud accounts.

## Precompiled Binaries

To install the precompiled binary, [download](/downloads) the appropriate
package for your system. Consul is currently packaged as a zip file. We do not
have any near term plans to provide system packages.

Once the zip is downloaded, unzip it into any directory. The `consul` binary
inside is all that is necessary to run Consul (or `consul.exe` for Windows). Any
additional files, if any, aren't required to run Consul.

Copy the binary to anywhere on your system. If you intend to access it from the
command-line, make sure to place it somewhere on your `PATH`.

```hcl
connect {
    enabled = true
    ca_provider = "vault"
    ca_config {
        address = "http://localhost:8213"
        token = "..."
        root_pki_path = "connect-root"
        intermediate_pki_path = "connect-intermediate"
    }
}
```

## Compiling from Source

To compile from source, you will need [Go](https://golang.org) installed and
configured properly (including a `GOPATH` environment variable set), as well as
a copy of [`git`](https://www.git-scm.com/) in your `PATH`.

1. Clone the Consul repository from GitHub into your `GOPATH`:

   ```shell
   $ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp && cd !$
   $ git clone https://github.com/hashicorp/consul.git
   $ cd consul
   ```

1. Bootstrap the project. This will download and compile libraries and tools
   needed to compile Consul:

   ```shell
   $ make tools
   ```

1. Build Consul for your current system and put the binary in `./bin/`
   (relative to the git checkout). The `make dev` target is just a shortcut that
   builds `consul` for only your local build environment (no cross-compiled
   targets).

   ```shell
   $ make dev
   ```

## Verifying the Installation

To verify Consul is properly installed, run `consul -v` on your system. You
should see help output. If you are executing it from the command line, make sure
it is on your PATH or you may get an error about Consul not being found.

```shell-session
$ consul -v
```

## Browser Compatibility Considerations

Consul currently supports all 'evergreen' browsers, as they are generally on
up-to-date versions. For more information on supported browsers, please see our
[FAQ](/docs/faq)
